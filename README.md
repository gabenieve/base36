base36
======

This is an example code to convert an integer to a base36 string value. It should also convert a base36 string value back to the integer equivalent. This functions/functionality should later be converted to a class, so that it may be used in any other code. Also as a requirement the last digit of our base 36 string should be base 35, which will eliminate the ‘E’ character from our conversion?
